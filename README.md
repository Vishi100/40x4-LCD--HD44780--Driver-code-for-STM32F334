# 40x4-LCD-Driver-for-STM32F334

Nucleo64 (64-pin package) has been used for this project. The MCU is STM32F334R8Tx. 40x4 LCD LM40400 (HD44780 equivalent) is the LCD used. It consists of two 40x2 LCDs. All the pins are shared by the two controllers of the LCD except for the enable pins.

TOOLCHAIN: 1) Drivers and project generated by STM32CubeMX software (version 4.18.0) http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html

2) Drivers and examples provided in STM32Cube_FW_F3_V1.6.0 http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef3.html

3) IDE - Kiel Âµvision (version 5.20.0.0)

4) Driver for flashing - STM32 ST-LINK utility (windows) http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-link004.html

STEPS: The complete preogramming has been done in GUI.

1) STM32CubeMX -> New Project In Board Selector tab, select Vendor(STMicroelectronics), Type of Board (Nucleo64) and MCU series(STM32F3). Next, select STM32F334R8Tx MCU from the board list. Clear the pinouts. Configure the GPIO pins as shown in the Cube file from the repository. Go to configuration tab. Now configure GPIO. Finally, click on 'Generate source code based on user settings'. Make the appropriate settings and select MDK-ARM V5 Toolchain. Open the Kiel project.

2) The C source code has been given in the main.c file from the repository. Copy and build the code. Flash the hex file and you are all set!

3) The output is displayed on the LCD.
